                "answer": "**Answer**: A good requirement statement should be clear, concise, and testable, effectively communicating what is needed from a system or product.\n\n**Details**:\n\n1. **Clarity**: Use simple and unambiguous language. Avoid jargon or technical terms that may not be understood by all stakeholders. For example, instead of saying \"The system should optimize performance,\" specify \"The system should reduce page load time to under 2 seconds.\"\n\n2. **Conciseness**: Keep the requirement statement brief while ensuring it conveys all necessary information. A concise statement is easier to understand and manage. For instance, instead of a lengthy description, say \"The application must support user authentication via email and password.\"\n\n3. **Testability**: Ensure that the requirement can be verified through testing. This means it should be possible to determine whether the requirement has been met. For example, \"The system shall allow users to reset their password via a confirmation email\" is testable because you can check if the password reset functionality works as described.\n\n4. **Specificity**: Be specific about what is required. Vague statements lead to misunderstandings. For example, instead of saying \"The system should be fast,\" specify \"The system should process transactions within 3 seconds.\"\n\n5. **Prioritization**: If applicable, indicate the priority of the requirement. This helps stakeholders understand which requirements are critical and which are nice-to-have. For example, \"High priority: The system must support at least 1000 concurrent users.\"\n\n6. **Consistency**: Ensure that the requirement is consistent with other requirements and does not contradict them. This helps maintain a coherent set of requirements.\n\n7. **Stakeholder Involvement**: Involve stakeholders in the requirement-gathering process to ensure that their needs and expectations are accurately captured. This can lead to more relevant and accepted requirements.\n\n### Example of a Good Requirement Statement:\n\"The online banking application shall allow users to transfer funds between accounts within 5 seconds, with a maximum transaction limit of $10,000 per transfer, and must provide a confirmation notification via email.\"\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can create effective requirement statements that facilitate clear communication and successful project outcomes.",

                "answer": "**Answer**: Failing to write complete requirements can lead to a range of negative outcomes, including project failure, misunderstandings, and wasted resources.\n\n**Details**:\n\n1. **Project Failure**: Incomplete or incorrect requirements can result in functionalities that do not meet the intended goals, ultimately leading to the failure of the project. When essential features are missing, the final product may not serve its purpose effectively.\n\n2. **Implicit Requirements**: When requirements are not explicitly documented, there is a risk that important aspects will be overlooked. This can lead to solutions that are incomplete and do not address all user needs.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Requirements**: A lack of clarity in requirements can create conflicting expectations among stakeholders. This inconsistency can result in confusion and disagreements, making it difficult to reach a consensus on project objectives.\n\n4. **Communication Flaws**: Poorly defined requirements can hinder effective communication between the project team and customers. Misunderstandings may arise, leading to unmet needs and dissatisfaction with the final product.\n\n5. **Changing Requirements**: Without a solid foundation of complete requirements, projects may struggle with shifting goals and business processes. This can create \"moving targets,\" complicating the project scope and making it challenging to deliver a cohesive solution.\n\n6. **Insufficient Support**: Incomplete requirements can lead to a lack of support from project leads or customers. When stakeholders do not fully understand the project\u2019s needs, they may not provide the necessary resources or guidance.\n\n7. **Gold Plating**: Teams may be tempted to add features that are not aligned with documented requirements, a practice known as gold plating. This can waste valuable resources and divert attention from the core objectives of the project.\n\n8. **Overlooking Stakeholder Needs**: A premature focus on solutions rather than thorough requirements gathering can result in overlooking the actual needs of stakeholders. This can lead to ineffective solutions that do not address the real problems at hand.\n\nIn summary, neglecting to write complete requirements can result in significant setbacks, including wasted time and resources, and ultimately, a product that fails to meet user expectations.",
