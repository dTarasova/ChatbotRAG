Context: of a structured and fully described requirements document, requirements are typically written down via user stories involving free form or with some constraints [43]. for this reason, the approach is focused on the user story format

Query: how to perform elicitation?
Context: in re survey research, there have been investigations of techniques and methods and investigationsof general practices. we will discuss the most relevant ones in the following.contributions that investigate techniques and methods analyse, for example, selected require-ments phases and which techniques are suitable to support typical tasks in those phases
Source: Status Quo in Requirements Engineering A Theory and a Global Family of Surveys.pdf

Query: how to prioritize all requirements my team proposed in order to deliver the most value quicker?
Context: . the newly created require-ments undergo the initial triage in a state called m0. next, upon consideredviable and suﬃciently justiﬁed, the requirement candidates are prioritized ina project prioritization state (similar to backlog prioritization), called m1. fi-nally, the prioritized requirements are hand-shaken with the developer teamsin a state called m2 [18]
Source: Causality in Requirements Artifacts Prevalence, Detection, and Impact.pdf

Context: . hence, fixing requirements during a sprint as, for example, emphasised in scrum seems important to address these causes. yet, overall the effects can be small: “if parties are on board that things are changing then the project won’t have problems in term of budget, timeline etc. because everybody knows these are flexible as long as targets are moving. it will cause stress for dev team though.”

Context: approach be applied? agile methods are characterized by having iterative structures that should allow early delivery, continual improvement, and rapid and flexible response to change [5]. hence, we envision that our approach is used just before a user story is defined as “ready” for codifying.

we propose our approach in two defined phases: (1)
Source: An Approach for Reviewing Security-Related Aspects in Agile Requirements Specifications of Web Applications.pdf

Query: why do i need re in agile environments?
Context: . this should also hold for the re process. therefore, we are interested in whether agile projects perform continuous improvement and what is their motivation. finally, after gathering an understanding about the state of the practice, we want to understand how important various potential problems for re are in agile projects and what are their causes and effects.
Source: Requirements Engineering Practice and Problems in Agile Projects Results from an International Survey.pdf

Context: . answers for other included “test-driven analysis for tdd projects”, “rerun test suites”, “we discuss with users and decide the best approach” and “team-based discussion before change”. therefore, besides looking at requirements and code, the test suites and direct discussions with stakeholders seem important for impact analyses in agile projects.

Context: fig. 7. is your requirements engineering continuously improved? 


hence, continuous improvement in general as well as in re is widespread in agile 


projects in practice. the motivation is intrinsic based on a perceived improved efficiency and because it is postulated by agile process models.

Query:  what are the main challenges in requirements engineering?
Context: the
most often mentioned problem in this ranking are incom-
plete and/or hidden requirements.
also mentioned often
are time boxing/not enough time and inconsistent require-
ments.
the most frequent answer for how those selected
problems manifest themselves in the process was change re-
quests and additional eﬀort (e.g. for meetings). when asked

Context: difficulties in understanding the problem, the business domain, 
and unclear goals and requirements. in the method category, the 
prevailing reported challenges concern difficulties in managing 
expectations, experienced data science knowledge, and establishing 
effective communication. finally, in the organization category, the 
lack of customer or domain expert availability and engagement

Context: implicit requirements not made explicit 
stakeholders with difficulties in separating reqs from previously known solutions 
inconsistent requirements 
insufficient support by project lead 
insufficient support by customer 
missing traceability 
“gold plating” (implementation of features without corresponding requirements) 
weak access to customer needs and / or (internal) business information

Context: requirements engineering is therefore both inherently difficult and a critical determinent for success. common reasons for project 
failure include nowaways incomplete, hidden and unclear requirements, and communication problems with customers. a lack of 
common understanding between stakeholders is a major challenge, as illustrated in the following picture.

Context: ware and system quality [10]. at the same time, requirements engineering is highly volatile and
inherently complex due to the involvement of interdisciplinary stakeholders and uncertainty about
many aspects that are not clear at the beginning of a project. the diversity of how requirements
engineering is performed in various industrial environments, each having its particularities in the

Context: different types and forms of requirements, including business, functional and non-functional, need to be carefully documented and 
managed. 
requirements can take different forms, such as natural language, structured formats or model-based approaches, each with its own 
advantages and disadvantages.

we used a 6-step procedure to collect the data
necessary for answering the research questions.

retrieved the requirements artifacts to be ana-
lyzed in each case. for one case, the require-
ments were stored in microsoft word documents.
for the other cases, this involved extracting the

Context: one of the core activities in requirements engineering is eliciting the requirements from relevant
stakeholders. to characterise the status quo, we want to understand what elicitation techniques
are employed in practice. in our theory from the first run, we expected practitioners, especially
in large companies, to conduct workshops as the central technique to elicit requirements. the

Context: requirements candidates into accepted requirements through vadalidation by the customers following the scope set out initially. this 
may be done in an manner as simple as asking them to formally accept the requirements in a written form and extend to employing a 
structured workshop with a walkthrough through all requirements and asking “why” questions (e.g. “why do you really need that

Query: how to deal with incomplete requirements?
Context: poor elicitation techniques, too abstract speciﬁcations, and missing completeness
checks. based on this information, an organisation facing this or similar problems
could take ﬁrst counter measures, such as:

training if needed, in particular, on avoiding abstract speciﬁcations. this could

that each stakeholder agrees at least on the wording and essence of a requirement to ensure that it is consistent with all specified

Context: information, or constant updates are necessary to satisfy needs [6–8].
as such inconsistencies occur, stakeholders’ usage can be under-
mined, and the efficiency of these artefacts is reduced. for example,
when a ba is mismanaged, learning across diverse groups becomes
limited and integrating additional knowledge is difficult [9]. more-

Context: common confusion and pitfalls
confusion often arises when stakeholders focus on implementation details before fully understanding and agreeing the requirements. 
this can lead to a number of problems:
overlooking stakeholder needs: discussing solutions prematurely can cause stakeholders to miss the real needs, resulting in 
solutions that don't address the right problems.
