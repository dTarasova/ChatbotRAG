Query: can you generate user stories from the following requirement?
Context: of a structured and fully described requirements document, requirements are typically written down via user stories involving free form or with some constraints [43]. for this reason, the approach is focused on the user story format

Query: how to perform elicitation?
Context: in re survey research, there have been investigations of techniques and methods and investigationsof general practices. we will discuss the most relevant ones in the following.contributions that investigate techniques and methods analyse, for example, selected require-ments phases and which techniques are suitable to support typical tasks in those phases
Source: Status Quo in Requirements Engineering A Theory and a Global Family of Surveys.pdf

Query: how to prioritize all requirements my team proposed in order to deliver the most value quicker?
Context: . the newly created require-ments undergo the initial triage in a state called m0. next, upon consideredviable and suﬃciently justiﬁed, the requirement candidates are prioritized ina project prioritization state (similar to backlog prioritization), called m1. fi-nally, the prioritized requirements are hand-shaken with the developer teamsin a state called m2 [18]
Source: Causality in Requirements Artifacts Prevalence, Detection, and Impact.pdf

Context: . hence, fixing requirements during a sprint as, for example, emphasised in scrum seems important to address these causes. yet, overall the effects can be small: “if parties are on board that things are changing then the project won’t have problems in term of budget, timeline etc. because everybody knows these are flexible as long as targets are moving. it will cause stress for dev team though.”

Context: approach be applied? agile methods are characterized by having iterative structures that should allow early delivery, continual improvement, and rapid and flexible response to change [5]. hence, we envision that our approach is used just before a user story is defined as “ready” for codifying.  


c. overview of our approach 


we propose our approach in two defined phases: (1)
Source: An Approach for Reviewing Security-Related Aspects in Agile Requirements Specifications of Web Applications.pdf

Query: why do i need re in agile environments?
Context: . this should also hold for the re process. therefore, we are interested in whether agile projects perform continuous improvement and what is their motivation. finally, after gathering an understanding about the state of the practice, we want to understand how important various potential problems for re are in agile projects and what are their causes and effects.
Source: Requirements Engineering Practice and Problems in Agile Projects Results from an International Survey.pdf

Context: . answers for other included “test-driven analysis for tdd projects”, “rerun test suites”, “we discuss with users and decide the best approach” and “team-based discussion before change”. therefore, besides looking at requirements and code, the test suites and direct discussions with stakeholders seem important for impact analyses in agile projects.

Context: fig. 7. is your requirements engineering continuously improved? 


hence, continuous improvement in general as well as in re is widespread in agile 


projects in practice. the motivation is intrinsic based on a perceived improved efficiency and because it is postulated by agile process models.
