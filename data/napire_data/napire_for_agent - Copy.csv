Whenever we discuss Requirements, new ideas Pop up. So we never are able to get a Quote and have development start. Also getting prototypes is difficult cause we Need to place new orders for every Change. Therefore we try to specify much upfront which brings us back to beginning - we don't get ready to go cause we have new ideas.  2) Last Versions we got back were rather Buggy. And then discussions started on if the Requirements are good enough, whether we should Hand out test cases, when to find time to write test cases. And also why things were not working any longer which used to work and how we can put that in Requirements, that  the System functionality as is must be kept working ...  3) We have a tool  break. Internally we specify in System A. But the external developer can not (or only very painfully) Access that System. So we have a self built Integration to System B. This should copy the Requirements and Bugs form A to B. But it does it only partially (attachments for Requirements are not carried over), IDs are randomly created in B so order of requirements and Logical structure gets lost. For Bugs attachments are handed over, but on the back-Syncronisation from B to A Images in the descriptions are lost...  ","1) we're trying to move to a concept where we allocate Budget for a year by rule of thumb. Then we try to specify small  increments  (a set of Features that together make sense and add a new Option.) and document them well. Have them implemented, check them and put them live. Then - if Budget is left - we'll try to address the next  increment .  2) We started with RE and me as an RE added to the Team after the first experience. Now we're disussing of making the (regression and new Feature validation) tests availble for the external development Team. Test Management adivised us earlier that this could be not a good idea cause once you Hand them over, discussions over  you Need to accept what we delivered  may occure and it would be more difficult to argue - well yes the tests are green - but still something is not as it should be and that is...  3) We're upgrading System A and it is supposed to have a working Integration with System B in its new Version. And also System A's new Version should have a prober working web-Login. So once we provide that the external development Team hopefully can log in from their Workstations to System A and check the Requirements, test cases and bugs...","We should get rid of the Money Problem ;->  Seriously: We Need to get a trust that the quotes are accurate. We Need to get a common understanding of the Requirements of all the Teams the internal end user Team as well as the external development. And we Need to have enough Money to do These discussion rounds. So the external development Teams Needs an Option to  bill  These refinements. And the paying end user Team Needs to see that this is needed and helpful.  We problably Need to formalize the states of Requirements a bit more so it is clear, when something is  ready for development  and whom it is adressed to.  We also Need the development Team to do more testing and implement automatic testing. We're going do Hand them over test cases and also small Videos of how to do use the product.

E.g. a reference to an external document rather than pulling out and specifying individual relevant requirements.,My role involves me acting as a translator between different groups of people.  I have to keep in mind the terminological differences and be ready ,"Undesirable behaviour sometimes evades detection until a late stage, since there was no explicit requirement there is no related test case.  Causes unnecessary churn as features have to be taken out later.",Developers do not have a big picture overview of the whole project and end up focusing on one sprint at a time.  This means features are sometimes implemented which are later found to be incompatible with a new feature. ,This can result in undesired features being accidentally carried over from other projects.  In past projects development was very painful as I encountered a developer who insisted the requirements were 'wrong' because 'that's not what the software does'.,NFRs are not tested with the same level of rigour as functional requirements.  This results in a risk of producing products with undetected reliability problems.

I work from a number of base principles that recognise the dynamic nature of dealing with complex problems in a business facing project. this includes making a distinction between 'tame' (well-defined_ problems and 'wicked' (ambiguous) problems. Most issues you face in the real world fall into the latter category and require very well matured analysis and interpersonal skills. These hard difficult to find skills in IT.,"Ensuring requirements meet the needs of the organisation are paramount to project success. All to often, IT projects are measured by the 'on time, on budget, on spec' criteria. As to whether projects meet organisational necessities is often overlooked, turning to the original specs to defend any inadequacies. Billions of dollars are spent each year on IT investment. The return on this investment is hazy at best and clearly missing at worst. this is one of the most overlooked and misunderstood areas of IT.","I was original schooled in SSADM/Waterfall methodologies for project management, as most IT project professionals are. I come to realise that approaches like this are more designed for the protection of IT teams who do not feel comfortable interacting with the business than the actual business benefits. It was not the methodology that accounted for the success of any projects I was involved with but the ability to communicate, build relationships and analyse ambiguous problems. I gained an understanding of the core problems in IT project management (Ref Cobb's Paradox), the fundamental principles that can help (ref Agile manifesto) and the pathology of any number of methodologies that attempt to fix it (including Agile in some cases). I celebrated this year the 21st Birthday of David Wastell's pivotal publication 'The Fetish of Technique: Methodology As A Social Defence'.

","First of all the structure of the teams, having many features to be developed by at least 3 teams makes no sense, specially if the teams don't have one single planning and refinement session, where everybody can align, making a project plan for that is not only over-engineered, but also plans cannot be always kept, as many interferences happen during the sprint (e.g. re-prioritization, encountered problems, refactorings, production bugs and hotfixes, etc).    Also the culture to stop promising features on dates long time ago, a roadmap that serves as a signed commitment rather than a guideline for priorities and the sequence in which they will be tackled.

When I start a project I clearly state what I believe to be the minimum level of requirements engineering and specification.  If the customer exceeds my expectations, no problem.  If it does not, I work hard to convince them to improve their requirements elicitation processes and I put a lot of energy into helping them.  If after a reasonable period (usually a few months) they haven't made movement in a positive direction, I leave the project.  In my experience, the key cause of project failure is poorly defined requirements.  I no longer  need the experience  so I do not stay with projects that have a low probability of success.","I find the wording of this question a bit confusing.  If my customer is not living up to my expectations, then the consequences are that a I don't work on the project.  If the customer heeds my advice and works to improve their requirements elicitation processes this usually results in a cultural change within the company.  I.e. after the project is completed and I leave to work on another, the people involved that remain in the company usually have a better understanding of why requirements elicitation is important and methods to do it well.","Mostly answered in question 27.  It's one thing to say to people on a project that their requirements elicitation processes are poor.  It's another to provide specific mechanisms that can be used to improve those processes.  As a consultant my role is not only to  develop software , but to aid my customers in any aspect of the process that can be improved.  Because I see poor requirements elicitation as one of the key causes of failure, I have spent a lot of my working career helping organizations to improve in this area.
