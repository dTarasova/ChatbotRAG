Acceptance criteria in support of the user story likewise lend themselves well to the defining of test cases.;Delivering increments of value to our customers in a timely, transparent fashion, based on their requirements.;In the first half of my career, I was involved in waterfall development projects. The amount of time it took to elicit, analyze, and document a full software requirements specification was lengthy, no one would actually read the document, and it was outdated by the time it was finished.

While management says that they understand it and are in agreement, in practice they still hold onto the traditional ways of thinking, and expect the outcomes of agile but with waterfall practices.

SW engineers insist in promoting a methodology that is not well necessarily well suited for complex systems and subject matter experts are often annoyed by implementing a methodology they don't understand.;RE is not only a SW engineering concern. I guess that all engineering domains may benefit of RE (from civil engineering, to mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, etc.).  The interdisciplinary is growing and the various trades shall share a same (similar?) approach to RE and it is not clear yet.  RE needs to grow in maturity.

More rework after the first version of the solution.;Miss understanding and incorrect requirements;Incorrect requirements. ;Delays;Delays, incorrect requirements;I fixed that we do use to much different tools for RE and it can take to much resources for RE activities. In many cases we have specific big tools for specific RE activities and goals, but how much time we spent on use of those tools. Does those tools support possibility to access to requirements to all involved persons, how easy those requirements we can export and import in situation when we change tools. Does the cost of tool, spent time on them and the result is in balance?   And during the project we do forget about the future - do we will have complete requirements and related information?  After the 6 month or more we do not remember what was in the solutions and how looks the last version of those requirements. We usually forgot to update requirements and do only partial documentation of requirements and changes. And in the result we have problems to find out what is the actual version and if we want to make changes in solutions we need to spent lot of time of existing solutions investigation. Of course we do not need to create big heavy documentation. We can use tool for requirements documentation and more, for example, for documented communication, requirements distribution etc.;I have noticed that when meets researcher and a practitioner in some experience exchange, for example in conference, there are lot of old topic from practitioners and new topics from researchers. And during the discussions there comes a misunderstanding. In the science field we are tended to create new innovations and new ideas for new situations, but we forgot to validate the previous ideas in practice. I'm a researcher also and a practitioner in the same time. And I realize that many RE methods, techniques etc isn't implemented fully in practice. And time after time practitioners came back and realize that the old method have some unanswered questions and the implementation is to complex.   In the result I came to question - do we need to much new innovations? Maybe we need to focus on existing methods and improve them. Maybe we need to make an inventory and think simpler. We need to encourage the practice, we need to improve productivity and support future work. RE practical field are strongly behind the science.    Sorry for my English.  I'm working on such topic like Continuous Requirements Engineering and one of my focus points are used tools and possibility to improve requirements use in future and requirements inheritance. If You are interested in collaboration, I will be glad to cooperate.

After that we either create new requirements or add notes to exsiting ones, clarifying them.;Dissatisfied;1) It takes Long time before we can start to develop and see prototypes. Whenever we discuss Requirements, new ideas Pop up. So we never are able to get a Quote and have development start. Also getting prototypes is difficult cause we Need to place new orders for every Change. Therefore we try to specify much upfront which brings us back to beginning - we don't get ready to go cause we have new ideas.  2) Last Versions we got back were rather Buggy. And then discussions started on if the Requirements are good enough, whether we should Hand out test cases, when to find time to write test cases. And also why things were not working any longer which used to work and how we can put that in Requirements, that  the System functionality as is must be kept working ...  3) We have a tool  break. Internally we specify in System A. But the external developer can not (or only very painfully) Access that System. So we have a self built Integration to System B. This should copy the Requirements and Bugs form A to B. But it does it only partially (attachments for Requirements are not carried over), IDs are randomly created in B so order of requirements and Logical structure gets lost. For Bugs attachments are handed over, but on the back-Syncronisation from B to A Images in the descriptions are lost...  ;1) we're trying to move to a concept where we allocate Budget for a year by rule of thumb. Then we try to specify small  increments  (a set of Features that together make sense and add a new Option.) and document them well. Have them implemented, check them and put them live. Then - if Budget is left - we'll try to address the next  increment .  2) We started with RE and me as an RE added to the Team after the first experience. Now we're disussing of making the (regression and new Feature validation) tests availble for the external development Team. Test Management adivised us earlier that this could be not a good idea cause once you Hand them over, discussions over  you Need to accept what we delivered  may occure and it would be more difficult to argue - well yes the tests are green - but still something is not as it should be and that is...  3) We're upgrading System A and it is supposed to have a working Integration with System B in its new Version. And also System A's new Version should have a prober working web-Login. So once we provide that the external development Team hopefully can log in from their Workstations to System A and check the Requirements, test cases and bugs...;"We should get rid of the Money Problem ;->  Seriously: We Need to get a trust that the quotes are accurate. We Need to get a common understanding of the Requirements of all the Teams the internal end user Team as well as the external development. And we Need to have enough Money to do These discussion rounds. So the external development Teams Needs an Option to  bill  These refinements. And the paying end user Team Needs to see that this is needed and helpful.  We problably Need to formalize the states of Requirements a bit more so it is clear, when something is  ready for development  and whom it is adressed to.  We also Need the development Team to do more testing and implement automatic testing. We're going do Hand them over test cases and also small Videos of how to do use the product.  Honestly we should Change to  times and materials  Projects and get regularly Meetings (using virtual Team rooms).

Very difficult in requirements to anticipate and specify everything that the product must NOT do.;Although all team members are meant to review requirements, time pressure means some team members do not consider them properly.;To meet timelines we have to reuse existing software to meet new customer requirements.  Not everyone understands that the customer expects a bespoke solution, we cannot force them to accept what we have available off the shelf.;Due to time pressure some non-functional requirements end up being less well specified than the functional requirements.  E.g. a reference to an external document rather than pulling out and specifying individual relevant requirements.;My role involves me acting as a translator between different groups of people.  I have to keep in mind the terminological differences and be ready ;Undesirable behaviour sometimes evades detection until a late stage, since there was no explicit requirement there is no related test case.  Causes unnecessary churn as features have to be taken out later.;Developers do not have a big picture overview of the whole project and end up focusing on one sprint at a time.  This means features are sometimes implemented which are later found to be incompatible with a new feature. ;This can result in undesired features being accidentally carried over from other projects.  In past projects development was very painful as I encountered a developer who insisted the requirements were 'wrong' because 'that's not what the software does'.;NFRs are not tested with the same level of rigour as functional requirements.

Another important aspect is that is does not take away the freedom of the developers to make good use of the development tools and frameworks. So the documents aim to support the development process, not to hinder it.  ;The documents help to consolidate the picture of what the software is doing. It is very important, that all stakeholders understand these documents (so clear and easy to read documents are the key). The consequences are that we get good feedback early on. This saves a lot of time and budget. It also helps to create good test cases. And most of the developers hate to read long or abstract analysis documents. ;There are many other projects that have bad analysis documents. In my opinion it is hard to change these once you have some kind of agreement from your stake holders to these artefacts - even if they are bad. If you change the documents after you got your OK from the stakeholders it is likely that you need some kind of them re-evaluated by the stake holders. That takes time and budget.

I work from a number of base principles that recognise the dynamic nature of dealing with complex problems in a business facing project. this includes making a distinction between 'tame' (well-defined_ problems and 'wicked' (ambiguous) problems. Most issues you face in the real world fall into the latter category and require very well matured analysis and interpersonal skills. These hard difficult to find skills in IT.;Ensuring requirements meet the needs of the organisation are paramount to project success. All to often, IT projects are measured by the 'on time, on budget, on spec' criteria. As to whether projects meet organisational necessities is often overlooked, turning to the original specs to defend any inadequacies. Billions of dollars are spent each year on IT investment. The return on this investment is hazy at best and clearly missing at worst. this is one of the most overlooked and misunderstood areas of IT.;I was original schooled in SSADM/Waterfall methodologies for project management, as most IT project professionals are. I come to realise that approaches like this are more designed for the protection of IT teams who do not feel comfortable interacting with the business than the actual business benefits. It was not the methodology that accounted for the success of any projects I was involved with but the ability to communicate, build relationships and analyse ambiguous problems. I gained an understanding of the core problems in IT project management (Ref Cobb's Paradox), the fundamental principles that can help (ref Agile manifesto) and the pathology of any number of methodologies that attempt to fix it (including Agile in some cases). I celebrated this year the 21st Birthday of David Wastell's pivotal publication 'The Fetish of Technique: Methodology As A Social Defence'. The IT professional will not learn or understand the importance of the interpersonal skills required for successful project management while it continues to promote methodology over human psychology.

'Soft' skills is a misnomer - they are the hardest and most valuable skills to find in IT.

Either way, it is understood that while it was different from a project that could have had more face communication, it not qualifies as a problem in itself, as it did not stop carrying out the project and its implementation according to the project plan.;Need for a team of Business Analysts with skills to detect different types of stakeholders, in order to address them in the best way (there are people who feel more comfortable showing what they do, others do not have problems to summarize and explain what they need and wish, while others feel uncomfortable exposing against others). It should be able to design a plan of requirements elicitation tailored to each case. I clarify that the project was in a food industry and those involved in the survey of requirements from the counterpart were direct users, which in some cases were business executives, and other plant personnel, so it is important to know the different profiles and the ability to communicate at all levels (operators, supervisors, managers). We find it very positive rely on teams with staff with specific knowledge of the business area for which software is being developed. We consider very positive the participation of  Security, Architecture and Testing personnel from the beginning of the project, which helps to define requirements that would otherwise arise in advanced stages, and could lead to rework.

Immersions in areas are becoming less prioritized, as well as the planning, in hours, to analyze the real needs of the client, analyzing the problems vs main cause, mapping and prioritization by business value vs complexity. I believe that the projects have an increasing number of people with more technical profiles (bit twiddler, hungry technology users without assessing their actual need). That's because a large part of these profiles do not have a great ability to abstract the requirements at different abstraction levels.;"Lack of visibility on the actual fulfillment of customer needs and on the resolution of the main cause for the problems; risks of software adherence to the business, resilience problems and requirements evolution due to its implementation without a complete understanding of business concepts; high software maintenance index";Make greater immersion in the areas to better identify and analyze the causes of problems, the real needs of the projects.;NotShown;NotShown;NotShown;Does rather not apply;Does rather not apply;Does rather not apply;Rather applies;Rather applies;Does not apply at all;Strongly applies;Rather applies;Does rather not apply;Strongly applies;Strongly applies;Strongly applies;Rather applies;Does rather not apply;Strongly applies;Rather applies;Rather applies;Rather applies;Strongly applies;Rather applies;Weak access to customer needs and / or (internal) business information;Insufficient support by project lead;Time boxing / Not enough time in general;Gold plating (implementation of features without corresponding requirements);Incomplete or hidden requirements;Elicitation phase is often ignored in the project;bit twiddler profile.

Should we spend project time documenting, or should we not document enough to keep project information as an asset of the company? I have observed that the concept of Agile has been misapplied in the projects and with that, many projects and companies have abdicated requirements engineering to respond quickly to clients / market. Thus, developing software has been treated as a commodity, which makes me very worried. Profiles that think only of technological solutions are increasingly common. With this, they are considered more important the ""how"" than ""what"" should be implemented."

previous requirements;Very dissatisfied;There is really no process for that, the IT Deparment of the company wants to sell and communicate that they are using agile methods, however all the structures, communication, analysis, project plans, stakeholder management and so on are fully oriented towards the old waterfall structure, and therefore  changing to agile  has meant a reduction of the RE process, increase in the coordination of the requirements with dependencies, leading to several delays and problems with the E2E testing, ligther documentation and shorter times, constant changes in the requirements (which is better than change management of fully specified systems), but overall it is very ad-hoc and the team does not have the maturity to ask the relevant questions during the refinements, so it becomes often a story of the PO to tell the developers what to do, without finding really insights or questions or impediments that need to be solved before going to the implementation.;The amount of bugs in production is terrible and so time consuming, they need to be again reported and prioritized in the backlog, the developers' time is already commited to many other topics right after release of the MVP, stakeholders still don't understand the concept of MVP and tend to think that with this version the fully functional feature is already live, customer feedback is not measured and introduced back to the development to improve the product, QA doesn't always know what exactly to test and to what extend, specially for integration tests, many projects are started and never really finished, things are often left undone. ;First of all the structure of the teams, having many features to be developed by at least 3 teams makes no sense, specially if the teams don't have one single planning and refinement session, where everybody can align, making a project plan for that is not only over-engineered, but also plans cannot be always kept, as many interferences happen during the sprint (e.g. re-prioritization, encountered problems, refactorings, production bugs and hotfixes, etc).    Also the culture to stop promising features on dates long time ago, a roadmap that serves as a signed commitment rather than a guideline for priorities and the sequence in which they will be tackled.    The understanding that Agile means also time for communication and a lot of discussions with the team, pair programming, knowledge sharing, and not 8 hours coding every day every sprint, the communication ceremonies and activities between all team members is also a productive activity. Change the mindset that Agile is achieving double in half the time, specially without communication, that is unrealistic and unproductive.;NotShown;NotShown;NotShown;Rather applies;Strongly applies;Rather applies;Strongly applies;Neutral;Neutral;Strongly applies;Rather applies;Strongly applies;Rather applies;Does rather not apply;0;Rather applies;Neutral;Strongly applies;Rather applies;Rather applies;Neutral;Neutral;Neutral;Weak knowledge about customer's application domain;Weak access to customer needs and / or (internal) business information;Communication flaws between the project and the customer;Time boxing / Not enough time in general;Technically unfeasible requirements;No feedback is captured from the real end-customers, requirements are coming from internal ideas, rather than supporting data after investigation;If there is any feedback being captured e.g. through customer service, this information is not know by the project team;I refer to customer as internal stakeholders: they have different ideas of what the system should and how, without really finding the need behind, also without considering that it is only 1 development team for at least 4 business units;1 development team (per area) and 1 platform for at least4 business units that are not aligned, and everybody wants everything by yesterday ;1 platform leads to a common base of the functionality and asking for contradictory features to that communality only increases complexity and makes in many cases no real business case;Failed attemps of increasing sales and revenue, no clear strategic direction;Failed attemps of increasing sales and revenue, or addressing customers correctly, no clear strategic direction, since no insights can be obtained;A bad image of the IT Team, perceived often as too slow, not performant, or a blocker, or incompetent, etc;A bad image of the IT Team, perceived often as too slow, not performant, or a blocker, or incompetent, etc;A bad image of the IT Team, perceived often as too slow, not performant, or a blocker, or incompetent, etc;Poor collaboration culture, when an error or failure occurs, the team spririt and collaboration are not much present, as long as it does not concern the team;Adopting Agile methodologies implies a bigger change and way of working than only changing tools and flows in IT (e.g. jira) and leaving business units untouched.

It is really hard to change the viewpoints of the people working in the environment, although everybody is aware, that there msut be a change in terms of beeing more user-centered.;People are frustated and start to give up thinking.

Also; Some functionality have a window of delivery (which must be met)";Stakeholders and customers assumption. For instance -  We assumed that all t-shirts are green.

Customer becomes frustrated but usually they agree that unknown requirements are hard to deliver - i.e. next sprint the requirement is known, and managed...;Reimplementation of already delivered functions. Project delay. The product is able to change and thus we are able to follow requirement changes well (it only takes more time);No;Maybe that our requirements tend to change a lot. This does not mean that we have a moving target, but rather that the reality where our systems work changes all the time and we need to keep up. I.e. changing requirements needs to be handled in a good way - both documentation, managing their impact and communicating to stakeholders. Rigid requirements are usually easier since they tend to stay the same form for a long time.    For instance: A requirement for the break pedal of a car is quite stable, but for the infotainment station in the same car the requirements may change each update/service for the car.

When I start a project I clearly state what I believe to be the minimum level of requirements engineering and specification.  If the customer exceeds my expectations, no problem.  If it does not, I work hard to convince them to improve their requirements elicitation processes and I put a lot of energy into helping them.  If after a reasonable period (usually a few months) they haven't made movement in a positive direction, I leave the project.  In my experience, the key cause of project failure is poorly defined requirements.  I no longer  need the experience  so I do not stay with projects that have a low probability of success.;I find the wording of this question a bit confusing.  If my customer is not living up to my expectations, then the consequences are that a I don't work on the project.  If the customer heeds my advice and works to improve their requirements elicitation processes this usually results in a cultural change within the company.  I.e. after the project is completed and I leave to work on another, the people involved that remain in the company usually have a better understanding of why requirements elicitation is important and methods to do it well.;Mostly answered in question 27.  It's one thing to say to people on a project that their requirements elicitation processes are poor.  It's another to provide specific mechanisms that can be used to improve those processes.  As a consultant my role is not only to  develop software , but to aid my customers in any aspect of the process that can be improved.  Because I see poor requirements elicitation as one of the key causes of failure, I have spent a lot of my working career helping organizations to improve in this area.  Sometimes I have been successful and sometimes not.  As the saying goes, I can only show them the door.  I cannot make them go through it.;Does rather not apply;Does rather not apply;Does not apply at all;Neutral;Neutral;Rather applies;Rather applies;Rather applies;Rather applies;Strongly applies;Neutral;Rather applies;Rather applies;Neutral;Strongly applies;Rather applies;Does not apply at all;Does not apply at all;Does not apply at all;Neutral;Communication flaws between the project and the customer;Communication flaws within the project team;Incomplete or hidden requirements;Gold plating (implementation of features without corresponding requirements);Stakeholders with difficulties in separating requirements from previously known solution designs;Organizational.

They generally do not see the value in requirements elicitation because they do not understand the consequences of doing it poorly.  They generally lack the experience to know what doing it well looks like.;While I see many developers scrimp on RE processes, I find that it is management that fails mostly here.  Non-technical management are often unwilling to take advice from a person with technical experience when it comes to process, and that typically leads to project failure.  I mentioned in previous questions that I have no problem leaving projects after a few months.  I see no point in spending my time on such projects.
