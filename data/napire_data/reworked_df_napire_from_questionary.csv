In many cases we have specific big tools for specific RE activities and goals, but how much time we spent on use of those tools. Does those tools support possibility to access to requirements to all involved persons, how easy those requirements we can export and import in situation when we change tools. Does the cost of tool, spent time on them and the result is in balance?   And during the project we do forget about the future - do we will have complete requirements and related information?  After the 6 month or more we do not remember what was in the solutions and how looks the last version of those requirements. We usually forgot to update requirements and do only partial documentation of requirements and changes. And in the result we have problems to find out what is the actual version and if we want to make changes in solutions we need to spent lot of time of existing solutions investigation. Of course we do not need to create big heavy documentation. We can use tool for requirements documentation and more, for example, for documented communication, requirements distribution etc.","I have noticed that when meets researcher and a practitioner in some experience exchange, for example in conference, there are lot of old topic from practitioners and new topics from researchers. And during the discussions there comes a misunderstanding. In the science field we are tended to create new innovations and new ideas for new situations, but we forgot to validate the previous ideas in practice. I'm a researcher also and a practitioner in the same time. And I realize that many RE methods, techniques etc isn't implemented fully in practice. And time after time practitioners came back and realize that the old method have some unanswered questions and the implementation is to complex.   In the result I came to question - do we need to much new innovations? Maybe we need to focus on existing methods and improve them. Maybe we need to make an inventory and think simpler. We need to encourage the practice, we need to improve productivity and support future work. RE practical field are strongly behind the science.    Sorry for my English.  I'm working on such topic like Continuous Requirements Engineering and one of my focus points are used tools and possibility to improve requirements use in future and requirements inheritance.

Whenever we discuss Requirements, new ideas Pop up. So we never are able to get a Quote and have development start. Also getting prototypes is difficult cause we Need to place new orders for every Change. Therefore we try to specify much upfront which brings us back to beginning - we don't get ready to go cause we have new ideas.  2) Last Versions we got back were rather Buggy. And then discussions started on if the Requirements are good enough, whether we should Hand out test cases, when to find time to write test cases. And also why things were not working any longer which used to work and how we can put that in Requirements, that  the System functionality as is must be kept working ...  3) We have a tool  break. Internally we specify in System A. But the external developer can not (or only very painfully) Access that System. So we have a self built Integration to System B. This should copy the Requirements and Bugs form A to B. But it does it only partially (attachments for Requirements are not carried over), IDs are randomly created in B so order of requirements and Logical structure gets lost. For Bugs attachments are handed over, but on the back-Syncronisation from B to A Images in the descriptions are lost...  ","1) we're trying to move to a concept where we allocate Budget for a year by rule of thumb. Then we try to specify small  increments  (a set of Features that together make sense and add a new Option.) and document them well. Have them implemented, check them and put them live. Then - if Budget is left - we'll try to address the next  increment .  2) We started with RE and me as an RE added to the Team after the first experience. Now we're disussing of making the (regression and new Feature validation) tests availble for the external development Team. Test Management adivised us earlier that this could be not a good idea cause once you Hand them over, discussions over  you Need to accept what we delivered  may occure and it would be more difficult to argue - well yes the tests are green - but still something is not as it should be and that is...  3) We're upgrading System A and it is supposed to have a working Integration with System B in its new Version. And also System A's new Version should have a prober working web-Login. So once we provide that the external development Team hopefully can log in from their Workstations to System A and check the Requirements, test cases and bugs...","We should get rid of the Money Problem ;->  Seriously: We Need to get a trust that the quotes are accurate. We Need to get a common understanding of the Requirements of all the Teams the internal end user Team as well as the external development. And we Need to have enough Money to do These discussion rounds. So the external development Teams Needs an Option to  bill  These refinements. And the paying end user Team Needs to see that this is needed and helpful.  We problably Need to formalize the states of Requirements a bit more so it is clear, when something is  ready for development  and whom it is adressed to.

So the documents aim to support the development process, not to hinder it.  ","The documents help to consolidate the picture of what the software is doing. It is very important, that all stakeholders understand these documents (so clear and easy to read documents are the key). The consequences are that we get good feedback early on. This saves a lot of time and budget. It also helps to create good test cases. And most of the developers hate to read long or abstract analysis documents. ","There are many other projects that have bad analysis documents. In my opinion it is hard to change these once you have some kind of agreement from your stake holders to these artefacts - even if they are bad. If you change the documents after you got your OK from the stakeholders it is likely that you need some kind of them re-evaluated by the stake holders. That takes time and budget.

I work from a number of base principles that recognise the dynamic nature of dealing with complex problems in a business facing project. this includes making a distinction between 'tame' (well-defined_ problems and 'wicked' (ambiguous) problems. Most issues you face in the real world fall into the latter category and require very well matured analysis and interpersonal skills. These hard difficult to find skills in IT.,"Ensuring requirements meet the needs of the organisation are paramount to project success. All to often, IT projects are measured by the 'on time, on budget, on spec' criteria. As to whether projects meet organisational necessities is often overlooked, turning to the original specs to defend any inadequacies. Billions of dollars are spent each year on IT investment. The return on this investment is hazy at best and clearly missing at worst. this is one of the most overlooked and misunderstood areas of IT.","I was original schooled in SSADM/Waterfall methodologies for project management, as most IT project professionals are. I come to realise that approaches like this are more designed for the protection of IT teams who do not feel comfortable interacting with the business than the actual business benefits. It was not the methodology that accounted for the success of any projects I was involved with but the ability to communicate, build relationships and analyse ambiguous problems. I gained an understanding of the core problems in IT project management (Ref Cobb's Paradox), the fundamental principles that can help (ref Agile manifesto) and the pathology of any number of methodologies that attempt to fix it (including Agile in some cases). I celebrated this year the 21st Birthday of David Wastell's pivotal publication 'The Fetish of Technique: Methodology As A Social Defence'. The IT professional will not learn or understand the importance of the interpersonal skills required for successful project management while it continues to promote methodology over human psychology.

","First of all the structure of the teams, having many features to be developed by at least 3 teams makes no sense, specially if the teams don't have one single planning and refinement session, where everybody can align, making a project plan for that is not only over-engineered, but also plans cannot be always kept, as many interferences happen during the sprint (e.g. re-prioritization, encountered problems, refactorings, production bugs and hotfixes, etc).    Also the culture to stop promising features on dates long time ago, a roadmap that serves as a signed commitment rather than a guideline for priorities and the sequence in which they will be tackled.    The understanding that Agile means also time for communication and a lot of discussions with the team, pair programming, knowledge sharing, and not 8 hours coding every day every sprint, the communication ceremonies and activities between all team members is also a productive activity.

When I start a project I clearly state what I believe to be the minimum level of requirements engineering and specification.  If the customer exceeds my expectations, no problem.  If it does not, I work hard to convince them to improve their requirements elicitation processes and I put a lot of energy into helping them.  If after a reasonable period (usually a few months) they haven't made movement in a positive direction, I leave the project.  In my experience, the key cause of project failure is poorly defined requirements.  I no longer  need the experience  so I do not stay with projects that have a low probability of success.","I find the wording of this question a bit confusing.  If my customer is not living up to my expectations, then the consequences are that a I don't work on the project.  If the customer heeds my advice and works to improve their requirements elicitation processes this usually results in a cultural change within the company.  I.e. after the project is completed and I leave to work on another, the people involved that remain in the company usually have a better understanding of why requirements elicitation is important and methods to do it well.","Mostly answered in question 27.  It's one thing to say to people on a project that their requirements elicitation processes are poor.  It's another to provide specific mechanisms that can be used to improve those processes.  As a consultant my role is not only to  develop software , but to aid my customers in any aspect of the process that can be improved.  Because I see poor requirements elicitation as one of the key causes of failure, I have spent a lot of my working career helping organizations to improve in this area.  Sometimes I have been successful and sometimes not.  As the saying goes, I can only show them the door.  I cannot make them go through it.",Does rather not apply,Does rather not apply,Does not apply at all,Neutral,Neutral,Rather applies,Rather applies,Rather applies,Rather applies,Strongly applies,Neutral,Rather applies,Rather applies,Neutral,Strongly applies,Rather applies,Does not apply at all,Does not apply at all,Does not apply at all,Neutral,Communication flaws between the project and the customer,Communication flaws within the project team,Incomplete or hidden requirements,Gold plating (implementation of features without corresponding requirements),Stakeholders with difficulties in separating requirements from previously known solution designs,Organizational.

They generally do not see the value in requirements elicitation because they do not understand the consequences of doing it poorly.  They generally lack the experience to know what doing it well looks like.,"While I see many developers scrimp on RE processes, I find that it is management that fails mostly here.  Non-technical management are often unwilling to take advice from a person with technical experience when it comes to process, and that typically leads to project failure.  I mentioned in previous questions that I have no problem leaving projects after a few months.  I see no point in spending my time on such projects.",Yes
