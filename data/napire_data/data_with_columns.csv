Acceptance criteria in support of the user story likewise lend themselves well to the defining of test cases.;Delivering increments of value to our customers in a timely, transparent fashion, based on their requirements.;In the first half of my career, I was involved in waterfall development projects. The amount of time it took to elicit, analyze, and document a full software requirements specification was lengthy, no one would actually read the document, and it was outdated by the time it was finished.

More rework after the first version of the solution.;Miss understanding and incorrect requirements;Incorrect requirements. ;Delays;Delays, incorrect requirements;I fixed that we do use to much different tools for RE and it can take to much resources for RE activities. In many cases we have specific big tools for specific RE activities and goals, but how much time we spent on use of those tools. Does those tools support possibility to access to requirements to all involved persons, how easy those requirements we can export and import in situation when we change tools. Does the cost of tool, spent time on them and the result is in balance?   And during the project we do forget about the future - do we will have complete requirements and related information?  After the 6 month or more we do not remember what was in the solutions and how looks the last version of those requirements. We usually forgot to update requirements and do only partial documentation of requirements and changes. And in the result we have problems to find out what is the actual version and if we want to make changes in solutions we need to spent lot of time of existing solutions investigation. Of course we do not need to create big heavy documentation. We can use tool for requirements documentation and more, for example, for documented communication, requirements distribution etc.;I have noticed that when meets researcher and a practitioner in some experience exchange, for example in conference, there are lot of old topic from practitioners and new topics from researchers. And during the discussions there comes a misunderstanding. In the science field we are tended to create new innovations and new ideas for new situations, but we forgot to validate the previous ideas in practice. I'm a researcher also and a practitioner in the same time. And I realize that many RE methods, techniques etc isn't implemented fully in practice. And time after time practitioners came back and realize that the old method have some unanswered questions and the implementation is to complex.   In the result I came to question - do we need to much new innovations? Maybe we need to focus on existing methods and improve them. Maybe we need to make an inventory and think simpler. We need to encourage the practice, we need to improve productivity and support future work. RE practical field are strongly behind the science.    Sorry for my English.  I'm working on such topic like Continuous Requirements Engineering and one of my focus points are used tools and possibility to improve requirements use in future and requirements inheritance. If You are interested in collaboration, I will be glad to cooperate. ;Yes;"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/61.0.3163.100 Safari/537.36";-99;0;Unknown;-99;Unknown;desktop;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;-99;-99;-66;-66;0;-66;2420013,2401449,2401450,2403398,2401451,2403254,2403672,2401452,2403647,2403284,2401453,2401454,2401455,2404980,2404982,2405011,2405407,2406406,2406658,2401447;Flipped;Flipped;HTML;-77;-77;18d1d2cd4646f1af4447f1a325cf9222;English;Not cleaned;1507792792;12.10.17 07:19;12.10.17 08:24;0000-00-00 00:00:00;614;638;704;1044;1164;1198;1247;0;802;1122;0;0;1522;1754;3142;3873;30

(i.e. Taking measurements of time with minutes and seconds yet customer was expecting seconds, milliseconds,, etc). ;Many times, requirements are ported from previous projects and sometimes, the requirements cannot be traced to features or statement of work. Many times, it turns out the requirement is an internal quality the product should have. ;Some requirements require experience in the field to be able to complete them. Therefore when someone is new to the project they have a bigger learning curve.;Many words get lost in translation and are difficult to decipher. ;As an engineer, I don't always deal with the customer and when I receive the requirements, I do not know why is the requirement even needed. Knowing a little more background always helps me create better implementation.;-99;-99;-99;-99;-99;-99;An interesting fact is that in my experience there is no an official Requirements Engineer. Rather, the job of creating requirements is usually given to someone who has years of experience in the project's field.

After that we either create new requirements or add notes to exsiting ones, clarifying them.;Dissatisfied;1) It takes Long time before we can start to develop and see prototypes. Whenever we discuss Requirements, new ideas Pop up. So we never are able to get a Quote and have development start. Also getting prototypes is difficult cause we Need to place new orders for every Change. Therefore we try to specify much upfront which brings us back to beginning - we don't get ready to go cause we have new ideas.  2) Last Versions we got back were rather Buggy. And then discussions started on if the Requirements are good enough, whether we should Hand out test cases, when to find time to write test cases. And also why things were not working any longer which used to work and how we can put that in Requirements, that  the System functionality as is must be kept working ...  3) We have a tool  break. Internally we specify in System A. But the external developer can not (or only very painfully) Access that System. So we have a self built Integration to System B. This should copy the Requirements and Bugs form A to B. But it does it only partially (attachments for Requirements are not carried over), IDs are randomly created in B so order of requirements and Logical structure gets lost. For Bugs attachments are handed over, but on the back-Syncronisation from B to A Images in the descriptions are lost...  ;1) we're trying to move to a concept where we allocate Budget for a year by rule of thumb. Then we try to specify small  increments  (a set of Features that together make sense and add a new Option.) and document them well. Have them implemented, check them and put them live. Then - if Budget is left - we'll try to address the next  increment .  2) We started with RE and me as an RE added to the Team after the first experience. Now we're disussing of making the (regression and new Feature validation) tests availble for the external development Team. Test Management adivised us earlier that this could be not a good idea cause once you Hand them over, discussions over  you Need to accept what we delivered  may occure and it would be more difficult to argue - well yes the tests are green - but still something is not as it should be and that is...  3) We're upgrading System A and it is supposed to have a working Integration with System B in its new Version. And also System A's new Version should have a prober working web-Login. So once we provide that the external development Team hopefully can log in from their Workstations to System A and check the Requirements, test cases and bugs...;"We should get rid of the Money Problem ;->  Seriously: We Need to get a trust that the quotes are accurate. We Need to get a common understanding of the Requirements of all the Teams the internal end user Team as well as the external development. And we Need to have enough Money to do These discussion rounds. So the external development Teams Needs an Option to  bill  These refinements. And the paying end user Team Needs to see that this is needed and helpful.  We problably Need to formalize the states of Requirements a bit more so it is clear, when something is  ready for development  and whom it is adressed to.  We also Need the development Team to do more testing and implement automatic testing. We're going do Hand them over test cases and also small Videos of how to do use the product.  Honestly we should Change to  times and materials  Projects and get regularly Meetings (using virtual Team rooms). But a fixed Budget is still needed to do planning and not simply spend more Money than we have...";-66;-66;-66;Does rather not apply;Strongly applies;Rather applies;Neutral;Does rather not apply;Does rather not apply;0;Neutral;Neutral;Rather applies;Does rather not apply;Neutral;Rather applies;Does rather not apply;Neutral;Strongly applies;Does rather not apply;Rather applies;Rather applies;Does rather not apply;Discrepancy between high degree of innovation and need for formal acceptance of (potentially wrong / incomplete / unknown) requirements;Communication flaws between the project and the customer;Please make a selection;Please make a selection;Please make a selection;need to assign budgets for too long periods (old way of thinking), rather volatile and unclear ideas of what customer wants and needs so prototypes needed to dicuss and go further;due to time needed for discussion which needs to be payed we try to fromulate requirements deeply ;-66;-66;-66;"uncomfortabel feeling on all sides - will we get where we want to be with this budget?; am I going to be held responsible for something I said on an uprecise set of requirements";"more and more writing of specifications; long documentation cycles in which we try to specify things but when we're finished the basics already changed so we need to adapt again";-66;-66;-66;-99;-99;Yes;"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko";-99;0;Unknown;-99;Unknown;desktop;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;-99;-99;-66;-66;0;-66;2420013,2401449,2401450,2403398,2401451,2403254,2403672,2401452,2403647,2401453,2401454,2401455,2404980,2404981,2404982,2405011,2405407,2406406,2406658,2401447;Flipped;Flipped;HTML;-77;-77;920de90b31eea238e8dd90992de9b94c;English;Not cleaned;1508140361;16.10.17 07:52;16.10.17 10:20;0000-00-00 00:00:00;5428;5848;5978;6435;6566;6666;6699;0;6172;0;8192;0;8402;8480;8776;8848;4572

Very difficult in requirements to anticipate and specify everything that the product must NOT do.;Although all team members are meant to review requirements, time pressure means some team members do not consider them properly.;To meet timelines we have to reuse existing software to meet new customer requirements.  Not everyone understands that the customer expects a bespoke solution, we cannot force them to accept what we have available off the shelf.;Due to time pressure some non-functional requirements end up being less well specified than the functional requirements.  E.g. a reference to an external document rather than pulling out and specifying individual relevant requirements.;My role involves me acting as a translator between different groups of people.  I have to keep in mind the terminological differences and be ready ;Undesirable behaviour sometimes evades detection until a late stage, since there was no explicit requirement there is no related test case.  Causes unnecessary churn as features have to be taken out later.;Developers do not have a big picture overview of the whole project and end up focusing on one sprint at a time.  This means features are sometimes implemented which are later found to be incompatible with a new feature. ;This can result in undesired features being accidentally carried over from other projects.  In past projects development was very painful as I encountered a developer who insisted the requirements were 'wrong' because 'that's not what the software does'.;NFRs are not tested with the same level of rigour as functional requirements.

Another important aspect is that is does not take away the freedom of the developers to make good use of the development tools and frameworks. So the documents aim to support the development process, not to hinder it.  ;The documents help to consolidate the picture of what the software is doing. It is very important, that all stakeholders understand these documents (so clear and easy to read documents are the key). The consequences are that we get good feedback early on. This saves a lot of time and budget. It also helps to create good test cases. And most of the developers hate to read long or abstract analysis documents. ;There are many other projects that have bad analysis documents. In my opinion it is hard to change these once you have some kind of agreement from your stake holders to these artefacts - even if they are bad. If you change the documents after you got your OK from the stakeholders it is likely that you need some kind of them re-evaluated by the stake holders. That takes time and budget. I don't know of any projects who did that. Most are more focused on the software, and once that is running that software artefacts take higher priority. For example a new feature is more likely to get funded than rewriting analysis documents.;Does not apply at all;Does not apply at all;Does rather not apply;Does rather not apply;Does not apply at all;Does not apply at all;Does rather not apply;Does rather not apply;Does rather not apply;Does rather not apply;Does rather not apply;0;Does rather not apply;Does not apply at all;Does rather not apply;Does rather not apply;Does rather not apply;0;Does rather not apply;Does not apply at all;Please make a selection;Please make a selection;Please make a selection;Please make a selection;Please make a selection;-66;-66;-66;-66;-66;-66;-66;-66;-66;-66;-99;-99;No;"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0";-99;0;Unknown;-99;Unknown;desktop;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;-99;-99;-66;-66;0;-66;2420013,2401449,2401450,2403398,2401918,2401451,2403254,2403672,2401452,2403647,2403284,2401453,2401454,2401455,2404980,2404982,2404996,2405011,2405407,2406406,2406406,2406658,2401447;Flipped;Flipped;HTML;-77;-77;d3bc5af2384d094d4ceb200c91dfbb7a;English;Not cleaned;1509438762;31.10.17 08:32;31.10.17 09:39;0000-00-00 00:00:00;152;481;1716;2064;2197;2230;2255;842;1741;2105;0;3732;3873;3936;3951;3992;6

I work from a number of base principles that recognise the dynamic nature of dealing with complex problems in a business facing project. this includes making a distinction between 'tame' (well-defined_ problems and 'wicked' (ambiguous) problems. Most issues you face in the real world fall into the latter category and require very well matured analysis and interpersonal skills. These hard difficult to find skills in IT.;Ensuring requirements meet the needs of the organisation are paramount to project success. All to often, IT projects are measured by the 'on time, on budget, on spec' criteria. As to whether projects meet organisational necessities is often overlooked, turning to the original specs to defend any inadequacies. Billions of dollars are spent each year on IT investment. The return on this investment is hazy at best and clearly missing at worst. this is one of the most overlooked and misunderstood areas of IT.;I was original schooled in SSADM/Waterfall methodologies for project management, as most IT project professionals are. I come to realise that approaches like this are more designed for the protection of IT teams who do not feel comfortable interacting with the business than the actual business benefits. It was not the methodology that accounted for the success of any projects I was involved with but the ability to communicate, build relationships and analyse ambiguous problems. I gained an understanding of the core problems in IT project management (Ref Cobb's Paradox), the fundamental principles that can help (ref Agile manifesto) and the pathology of any number of methodologies that attempt to fix it (including Agile in some cases). I celebrated this year the 21st Birthday of David Wastell's pivotal publication 'The Fetish of Technique: Methodology As A Social Defence'. The IT professional will not learn or understand the importance of the interpersonal skills required for successful project management while it continues to promote methodology over human psychology.

En la etapa de validaciÃ_n, participaron algunos usuarios (recursos del cliente), que no habÃ_an participado durante la etapa de relevamiento, lo que hizo que aparecieran algunos nuevos requisitos.  ;Does not apply at all;Does rather not apply;Does rather not apply;Does rather not apply;Does not apply at all;Does not apply at all;Neutral;Does not apply at all;Neutral;Rather applies;Does not apply at all;Does not apply at all;Does not apply at all;Does not apply at all;Does rather not apply;Does rather not apply;Does not apply at all;Does not apply at all;Does not apply at all;Does not apply at all;Moving targets (changing goals, business processes and / or requirements);Incomplete or hidden requirements;Stakeholders with difficulties in separating requirements from previously known solution designs;Please make a selection;Please make a selection;Alta rotaciÃ_n de personal en el cliente;No se asignaron correctamente en algunos casos los usuarios interlocutores para el relevamiento de requerimientos;El cliente pasaba de trabajar con planillas a comenzar a trabajar con un sistema, lo que llevaba a algunos de los usuarios (no ocurriÃ_ en todos los casos), a intentar reproducir las planillas en lugar de buscar la mejor soluciÃ_n;-66;-66;ActualizaciÃ_n de planes, con mayores tiempos de desarrollo, aumento de las Solicitudes de Cambios;Nuevo relevamiento de algunos requisitos en etapa que deberÃ_a haber sido de validaciÃ_n, actualizaciÃ_n de planes;En algunos casos llevÃ_ a presentar dos soluciones diferentes (con prototipos), para que el usuario pudiera seleccionar (la que el usuario habÃ_a solicitado, y la que se entendÃ_a de parte del equipo de proyecto que podÃ_a ser la mejor soluciÃ_n);-66;-66;El proyecto era en una industria en otro paÃ_s, por lo que se debÃ_a optimizar al mÃ¡ximo las instancias de relevamiento/validaciÃ_n/capacitaciÃ_n presencial (las cuales no fueron muchas), y trabajar adecuadamente con las teleconferencias durante todo el proyecto, lo que llevaba a veces a que no estuvieran disponibles para las mismas todos los interlocutores de parte del cliente que hubiesen sido necesarios, lo que llevÃ_ a tener que planificar y gestionar muy bien los tiempos, pues en algunas ocasiones se demoraba una demostraciÃ_n, validaciÃ_n, etc.  De cualquier manera, se entiende que si bien fue un diferencial frente a un proyecto en el que se hubiese podido tener mÃ¡s comunicaciÃ_n presencial no el cliente, no se lo califica como un problema en sÃ_ mismo, ya que no impidiÃ_ llevar adelante el proyecto y su implantaciÃ_n de acuerdo al plan de proyecto.;Necesidad de contar con un equipo de Analistas de Negocio con habilidades para detectar los diferentes tipos de interlocutores, de manera de abordarlos de la mejor manera (hay personas que se sienten mÃ¡s cÃ_modas mostrando lo que hacen, otras no tienen inconvenientes en resumir y explicar lo que necesitan, y desearÃ_an, mientras que otras se sienten incÃ_modas exponiendo frente a los demÃ¡s). Se deberÃ_a poder diseÃ±ar un plan de relevamiento de requerimientos adaptado a cada caso. Hago la aclaraciÃ_n que el proyecto fue en una industria alimenticia, y quienes participaban del relevamiento de requerimientos por parte de la contraparte eran los usuarios directos, que en algÃºn caso eran los Ejecutivos Comerciales, como en otros el personal de planta, por lo que es importante conocer los diferentes perfiles y tener la habilidad para comunicarse a todo nivel (operarios, supervisores, gerentes).  Nos resulta muy positivo contar en los equipos con personal con conocimientos especÃ_ficos sobre el Ã¡rea de negocio para el cual se estÃ¡ desarrollando el software.  Nos resulta muy positivo contar con participantes de Seguridad, Arquitectura y Testing desde los comienzos del proyecto, lo que ayuda a definir requerimientos que de otra manera surgirÃ_an en etapas avanzadas, y podrÃ_an generar reprocesos.;Yes;"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/61.0.3163.100 Safari/537.36";-99;0;Unknown;-99;Unknown;desktop;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;-99;-99;-66;-66;0;-66;2420013,2401449,2401450,2401450,2401450,2403398,2401918,2401451,2403254,2403672,2401452,2403647,2403284,2401453,2401454,2401455,2404980,2404982,2404996,2405011,2405407,2406406,2406658,2401447;Flipped;Flipped;HTML;-77;-77;46f2bed461a91ad1a0f43db6b62d1270;ES;Not cleaned;1510663464;14.11.17 12:44;14.11.17 13:53;0000-00-00 00:00:00;348;1232;1451;1651;1855;1908;1940;1234;1471;1707;0;2233;2577;2640;3545;4124;40

Acredito que os projetos possuem cada vez mais perfis tÃ©cnicos (escovadores de bits, sedentos aplicadores de tecnologia sem avaliaÃ§Ã£o da sua real necessidade).

Gastar  tempo do projeto documentando ou nÃ£o documentar o suficiente para manter as informaÃ§Ãµes do projeto como um ativo da empresa?  Tenho observado que o conceito de ÃÅgil tem sido mal aplicado nos projetos e com isso, muitos projetos e empresas tÃªm abdicado da engenharia de requisitos para dar respostas rÃ¡pidas ao cliente / mercado. Com isso, desenvolver software tem sido tratado como se fosse commodity, o que me faz ficar muito preocupado.   Perfis que pensam somente em soluÃ§Ãµes tecnolÃ_gicas sÃ£o cada vez mais comuns.

Trabalhar com user stories e ir refinando-as de acordo com a necessidade de implementÃ¡-las fez com que o produto fosse entregue de uma forma bem mais rÃ¡pida e podemos testar o produto e realizar mudanÃ§as mais rapidamente. ;Rather applies;Rather applies;Rather applies;Rather applies;Does rather not apply;Does not apply at all;Does rather not apply;Does rather not apply;Rather applies;Strongly applies;Rather applies;Does not apply at all;Does rather not apply;Does rather not apply;Neutral;Does rather not apply;Does rather not apply;Rather applies;Rather applies;Rather applies;Communication flaws within the project team;Communication flaws between the project and the customer;Insufficient support by project lead;Missing traceability;Discrepancy between high degree of innovation and need for formal acceptance of (potentially wrong / incomplete / unknown) requirements;No momento de entrega, deixamos de fazer alguns ritos que sÃ£o importantes par ao projeto. ;Product Owner centralizador. ;- ;NÃ£o hÃ¡ muito histÃ_rico do que foi feito anteriormente. ;-99;Falta de transparencia;Entregas nÃ£o alinhadas com o cliente;Talvez os problemas de comunicaÃ§Ã£o poderiam ser sanados com uma lideranÃ§a mais eficiente;Probemas para identificar coisas que foram feitas e o seu histÃ_rico. ;- ;-99;-66;-77;"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.94 Safari/537.36";-99;0;Unknown;-99;Unknown;desktop;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;-99;-99;-66;-66;0;-66;2420013,2401449,2401450,2403398,2401918,2401451,2403254,2403672,2401452,2403647,2403284,2401453,2401454,2401455,2404980,2404982,2404996,2405011,2405407,2406406,2406658;Not flipped;Not flipped;HTML;-77;-77;63b40a1fadfda6a9097a6302dce62418;PT;Not cleaned;1512748398;08.12.17 15:53;11.12.17 14:47;0000-00-00 00:00:00;16;197;265;391;487;498;504;226;274;441;0;756;251159;251273;255279;0;7

Also the culture to stop promising features on dates long time ago, a roadmap that serves as a signed commitment rather than a guideline for priorities and the sequence in which they will be tackled.    The understanding that Agile means also time for communication and a lot of discussions with the team, pair programming, knowledge sharing, and not 8 hours coding every day every sprint, the communication ceremonies and activities between all team members is also a productive activity. Change the mindset that Agile is achieving double in half the time, specially without communication, that is unrealistic and unproductive.;-66;-66;-66;Rather applies;Strongly applies;Rather applies;Strongly applies;Neutral;Neutral;Strongly applies;Rather applies;Strongly applies;Rather applies;Does rather not apply;0;Rather applies;Neutral;Strongly applies;Rather applies;Rather applies;Neutral;Neutral;Neutral;Weak knowledge about customer's application domain;Weak access to customer needs and / or (internal) business information;Communication flaws between the project and the customer;Time boxing / Not enough time in general;Technically unfeasible requirements;No feedback is captured from the real end-customers, requirements are coming from internal ideas, rather than supporting data after investigation;If there is any feedback being captured e.g. through customer service, this information is not know by the project team;I refer to customer as internal stakeholders: they have different ideas of what the system should and how, without really finding the need behind, also without considering that it is only 1 development team for at least 4 business units;1 development team (per area) and 1 platform for at least4 business units that are not aligned, and everybody wants everything by yesterday ;1 platform leads to a common base of the functionality and asking for contradictory features to that communality only increases complexity and makes in many cases no real business case;Failed attemps of increasing sales and revenue, no clear strategic direction;Failed attemps of increasing sales and revenue, or addressing customers correctly, no clear strategic direction, since no insights can be obtained;A bad image of the IT Team, perceived often as too slow, not performant, or a blocker, or incompetent, etc;A bad image of the IT Team, perceived often as too slow, not performant, or a blocker, or incompetent, etc;A bad image of the IT Team, perceived often as too slow, not performant, or a blocker, or incompetent, etc;Poor collaboration culture, when an error or failure occurs, the team spririt and collaboration are not much present, as long as it does not concern the team;Adopting Agile methodologies implies a bigger change and way of working than only changing tools and flows in IT (e.g. jira) and leaving business units untouched.;Yes;"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.87 Safari/537.36";http://www.mendezfe.org/projects/napire/;0;Unknown;-99;Unknown;desktop;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;-99;-99;-66;-66;0;-66;2420013,2401449,2401450,2403398,2401451,2401451,2401451,2403254,2403672,2401452,2403647,2401453,2401454,2401455,2404980,2404981,2404982,2405011,2405407,2406406,2406658,2406658,2401447;Not flipped;Not flipped;HTML;-77;-77;95f1f667c5ca01e486988fe7f88dba86;English;Not cleaned;1515622168;10.01.18 22:09;10.01.18 23:40;0000-00-00 00:00:00;1087;1365;2243;2618;2960;3080;3135;0;2332;0;4260;0;4414;4512;5393;5476;231

It is really hard to change the viewpoints of the people working in the environment, although everybody is aware, that there msut be a change in terms of beeing more user-centered.;People are frustated and start to give up thinking.

Customer becomes frustrated but usually they agree that unknown requirements are hard to deliver - i.e. next sprint the requirement is known, and managed...;Reimplementation of already delivered functions. Project delay. The product is able to change and thus we are able to follow requirement changes well (it only takes more time);No;Maybe that our requirements tend to change a lot. This does not mean that we have a moving target, but rather that the reality where our systems work changes all the time and we need to keep up. I.e. changing requirements needs to be handled in a good way - both documentation, managing their impact and communicating to stakeholders. Rigid requirements are usually easier since they tend to stay the same form for a long time.    For instance: A requirement for the break pedal of a car is quite stable, but for the infotainment station in the same car the requirements may change each update/service for the car.;Yes;"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/63.0.3239.132 Safari/537.36";https://l.facebook.com/;0;Unknown;-99;Unknown;desktop;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;-99;-99;-66;-66;0;-66;2420013,2401449,2401449,2401450,2403398,2401918,2401451,2403254,2403672,2401452,2403647,2403284,2401453,2401454,2401455,2404980,2404982,2404996,2405011,2405407,2406406,2406658,2401447;Flipped;Flipped;HTML;-77;-77;4b7db8c9803d55f0622ca1fc1c700e81;English;Not cleaned;1516216507;17.01.18 19:15;17.01.18 19:53;0000-00-00 00:00:00;24;166;283;480;734;747;756;247;351;643;0;1188;1345;1433;2074;2281;22

When I start a project I clearly state what I believe to be the minimum level of requirements engineering and specification.  If the customer exceeds my expectations, no problem.  If it does not, I work hard to convince them to improve their requirements elicitation processes and I put a lot of energy into helping them.  If after a reasonable period (usually a few months) they haven't made movement in a positive direction, I leave the project.  In my experience, the key cause of project failure is poorly defined requirements.  I no longer  need the experience  so I do not stay with projects that have a low probability of success.;I find the wording of this question a bit confusing.  If my customer is not living up to my expectations, then the consequences are that a I don't work on the project.  If the customer heeds my advice and works to improve their requirements elicitation processes this usually results in a cultural change within the company.  I.e. after the project is completed and I leave to work on another, the people involved that remain in the company usually have a better understanding of why requirements elicitation is important and methods to do it well.;Mostly answered in question 27.  It's one thing to say to people on a project that their requirements elicitation processes are poor.  It's another to provide specific mechanisms that can be used to improve those processes.  As a consultant my role is not only to  develop software , but to aid my customers in any aspect of the process that can be improved.  Because I see poor requirements elicitation as one of the key causes of failure, I have spent a lot of my working career helping organizations to improve in this area.  Sometimes I have been successful and sometimes not.  As the saying goes, I can only show them the door.  I cannot make them go through it.;Does rather not apply;Does rather not apply;Does not apply at all;Neutral;Neutral;Rather applies;Rather applies;Rather applies;Rather applies;Strongly applies;Neutral;Rather applies;Rather applies;Neutral;Strongly applies;Rather applies;Does not apply at all;Does not apply at all;Does not apply at all;Neutral;Communication flaws between the project and the customer;Communication flaws within the project team;Incomplete or hidden requirements;Gold plating (implementation of features without corresponding requirements);Stakeholders with difficulties in separating requirements from previously known solution designs;Organizational.

They generally do not see the value in requirements elicitation because they do not understand the consequences of doing it poorly.  They generally lack the experience to know what doing it well looks like.;While I see many developers scrimp on RE processes, I find that it is management that fails mostly here.  Non-technical management are often unwilling to take advice from a person with technical experience when it comes to process, and that typically leads to project failure.  I mentioned in previous questions that I have no problem leaving projects after a few months.  I see no point in spending my time on such projects.;Yes;"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:58.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/58.0";-99;0;Unknown;-99;Unknown;desktop;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;-99;-99;-66;-66;0;-66;2420013,2401449,2401450,2401450,2401450,2403398,2401451,2403254,2403672,2401452,2403647,2403284,2401453,2401454,2401455,2404980,2404982,2404996,2405011,2405407,2406406,2406658,2401447;Flipped;Not flipped;HTML;-77;-77;a8b2e2922fa4ce50e5099afbf764a70a;English;Not cleaned;1517686871;03.02.18 19:41;03.02.18 20:20;0000-00-00 00:00:00;72;415;505;665;820;838;844;0;516;774;0;1538;1691;1787;2191;2366;10
