Interviews: Business analysts conduct interviews with stakeholders to gather information about their needs, requirements, and expectations.\\n\\n2. Workshops: Workshops are interactive sessions where stakeholders come together to discuss and define requirements collaboratively.\\n\\n3. Surveys and Questionnaires: Business analysts use surveys and questionnaires to collect feedback and input from a large number of stakeholders.\\n\\n4. Observations: Observing stakeholders in their work environment helps business analysts understand their processes, challenges, and requirements.\\n\\n5. Document Analysis: Business analysts review existing documentation such as reports, manuals, and requirements documents to extract relevant information.\\n\\n6. Prototyping: Creating prototypes or mockups of the proposed solution helps stakeholders visualize the final product and provide feedback.\\n\\n7. Brainstorming: Brainstorming sessions encourage stakeholders to generate ideas and solutions collectively.\\n\\nThese are just a few examples of elicitation techniques that business analysts commonly use to gather requirements and information from stakeholders.'"
