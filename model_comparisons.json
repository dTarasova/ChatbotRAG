            "GPT": "### Answer:  \nTo write a good requirement statement, ensure it is clear, concise, testable, and specific to the needs of the stakeholders.\n\n### Details:  \n\n#### 1. **Clarity**  \nA requirement statement should be easily understood by all stakeholders, including technical and non-technical individuals. Avoid jargon and ambiguous terms.\n\n#### 2. **Conciseness**  \nKeep the statement brief while still conveying the necessary information. A long-winded requirement can lead to misunderstandings.\n\n#### 3. **Testability**  \nEach requirement should be measurable or verifiable. This means that there should be a clear way to determine if the requirement has been met.\n\n#### 4. **Specificity**  \nBe specific about what is required. Vague statements can lead to different interpretations, which can cause issues during implementation.\n\n#### 5. **Stakeholder Focus**  \nRequirements should reflect the needs and expectations of the stakeholders involved. Understanding who the end-users are and what they need is crucial.\n\n### Example:  \n**Poor Requirement Statement:**  \n\"The system should be user-friendly.\"\n\n**Improved Requirement Statement:**  \n\"The system shall allow users to complete the registration process in no more than three steps, with each step clearly labeled and providing guidance on required information.\"\n\n#### Breakdown of the Improved Statement:  \n- **Clarity:** The term \"user-friendly\" is replaced with a specific process (registration) and a measurable outcome (no more than three steps).\n- **Conciseness:** The statement is direct and to the point.\n- **Testability:** The requirement can be tested by counting the steps in the registration process.\n- **Specificity:** It specifies what the user experience should entail (clear labeling and guidance).\n- **Stakeholder Focus:** It addresses the needs of users who may be unfamiliar with the system.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can create effective requirement statements that facilitate successful project outcomes.",
            "RAG": "### Answer:  \nTo write a good requirement statement, focus on clarity, specificity, and alignment with stakeholder needs while ensuring that the requirements are structured and verifiable.\n\n### Details:  \n\n#### Key Elements of a Good Requirement Statement:\n1. **Clarity and Unambiguity**: Each requirement should be stated clearly and without ambiguity. This ensures that everyone involved understands the requirement in the same way.\n\n2. **Singularity**: A requirement should address only one characteristic or constraint. This prevents confusion and makes it easier to verify.\n\n3. **Feasibility**: Ensure that the requirement is achievable within the project's constraints, including time, budget, and resources.\n\n4. **Verifiability**: Each requirement must be testable, meaning there should be a clear way to determine if it has been met.\n\n5. **Correctness**: The requirement should accurately reflect the needs and expectations of stakeholders.\n\n6. **Modularity**: Organize requirements into modules based on related topics, which enhances maintainability and clarity.\n\n7. **Traceability**: Each requirement should have a rationale, allowing stakeholders to understand why it is necessary.\n\n8. **Performance and Usability Considerations**: Address aspects like performance efficiency, usability, and security to ensure the system meets user needs and operates effectively.\n\n9. **Documentation Granularity**: Specify the level of detail required in documentation to ensure clarity and comprehensiveness.\n\n### Example:  \nConsider a requirement for a software application that manages user accounts. A poorly written requirement might state:\n\n- \"The system should allow users to log in.\"\n\nThis statement lacks clarity and specificity. A better requirement would be:\n\n- **\"The system shall allow users to log in using a username and password, with a maximum of three failed attempts before locking the account for 15 minutes.\"**\n\nThis revised statement is clear, unambiguous, and includes specific conditions (username and password, maximum attempts, and lockout duration). It also allows for easy verification (by testing the login functionality) and reflects the needs of stakeholders (security and user experience). \n\nBy following these principles, you can create effective requirement statements that contribute to the success of your project."
