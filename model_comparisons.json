            "GPT": "Certainly! A textual use case is a detailed description of a specific interaction between a user (or \"actor\") and a system to achieve a particular goal. It outlines the steps involved in the interaction, including the preconditions, main flow, alternative flows, and postconditions. Here\u2019s a detailed example of a textual use case for an online shopping system:\n\n### Use Case: Purchase Product\n\n**Use Case ID:** UC-001  \n**Use Case Name:** Purchase Product  \n**Actor:** Customer  \n**Preconditions:**  \n- The customer must have an active account on the online shopping platform.  \n- The customer must be logged into their account.  \n- The customer must have at least one item in their shopping cart.  \n\n**Postconditions:**  \n- The customer receives an order confirmation.  \n- The inventory is updated to reflect the purchased items.  \n- The payment is processed, and the transaction is recorded.\n\n**Main Flow:**  \n1. The customer navigates to the shopping cart page.  \n2. The system displays the items in the shopping cart along with their prices and total amount.  \n3. The customer reviews the items and clicks on the \"Proceed to Checkout\" button.  \n4. The system prompts the customer to select a shipping address.  \n5. The customer selects a shipping address or enters a new one.  \n6. The system displays available shipping options and their costs.  \n7. The customer selects a shipping option.  \n8. The system prompts the customer to select a payment method.  \n9. The customer selects a payment method (e.g., credit card, PayPal).  \n10. The system prompts the customer to enter payment details.  \n11. The customer enters the payment details and clicks on the \"Confirm Purchase\" button.  \n12. The system processes the payment.  \n13. If the payment is successful, the system updates the inventory and generates an order confirmation.  \n14. The system displays the order confirmation to the customer, including order number and estimated delivery date.  \n\n**Alternative Flows:**  \n- **Alternative Flow 1: Payment Failure**  \n  1. If the payment fails (e.g., insufficient funds, invalid card), the system displays an error message.  \n  2. The customer is prompted to re-enter payment details or select a different payment method.  \n  3. The customer can choose to cancel the purchase or retry the payment process.  \n\n- **Alternative Flow 2: No Items in Cart**  \n  1. If the customer attempts to proceed to checkout with an empty cart, the system displays a message indicating that the cart is empty.  \n  2. The customer is redirected to the product catalog to add items to the cart.  \n\n**Special Requirements:**  \n- The system must comply with PCI DSS standards for handling payment information.  \n- The system should provide a secure connection (HTTPS) during the payment process.  \n- The order confirmation should be sent to the customer\u2019s registered email address.\n\nThis textual use case provides a comprehensive overview of the process involved in purchasing a product from an online shopping system, detailing the interactions, conditions, and potential variations in the flow.",
