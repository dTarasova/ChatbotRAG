            "GPT": "### Answer:  \nThe system should have a response time that meets user expectations for efficiency and performance.\n\n### Details:  \n\n#### Definition of \"Fast\"  \nWhen we say a system should be \"fast,\" we need to clarify what that means in practical terms. **_Response time_** is a critical factor; it refers to how quickly the system reacts to user inputs or requests. \n\n#### User Expectations  \nDifferent users have different expectations based on their experiences with similar systems. For instance, a user might expect a webpage to load within a few seconds, while a mobile app should respond to taps almost instantly. Therefore, defining \"fast\" involves understanding the context in which the system will be used.\n\n#### Performance Metrics  \nTo ensure the system is perceived as fast, we can establish specific performance metrics. These could include:\n- **_Load time_**: The time it takes for the system to become usable after a user initiates an action.\n- **_Processing time_**: The duration it takes for the system to complete a task after receiving a request.\n- **_Throughput_**: The number of transactions or requests the system can handle in a given timeframe.\n\n### Example:  \nConsider an online shopping website. If a user clicks on a product to view its details, the system should ideally display the product information within a few seconds. If it takes longer, users may become frustrated and abandon their shopping experience. \n\nIn this case, we could specify that the system should have a **_maximum response time_** of 3 seconds for product detail pages and a **_maximum load time_** of 2 seconds for the homepage. This way, we provide clear expectations for performance that can be measured and tested. \n\nBy defining \"fast\" in these terms, we create a more actionable requirement that can guide the development and evaluation of the system.",
            "RAG": "### Answer:  \nThe requirement can be reformulated as: \"The system should respond to user requests within two seconds under normal operating conditions.\"\n\n### Details:  \n#### Importance of Clarity in Requirements  \nA clear requirement is essential for effective communication among stakeholders, including developers, testers, and users. Vague terms like \"fast\" can lead to misunderstandings and misaligned expectations. \n\n#### Characteristics of a Good Requirement  \n- **Specificity**: Clearly defines what is expected.\n- **Measurable**: Allows for assessment of whether the requirement has been met.\n- **Contextual**: Takes into account the conditions under which the system will operate.\n\n### Example:  \nConsider the original requirement: \"The system should be fast.\" This is ambiguous because \"fast\" can mean different things to different people. \n\n1. **Reformulated Requirement**: \"The system should respond to user requests within two seconds under normal operating conditions.\"\n   - **Specificity**: It specifies a response time.\n   - **Measurable**: The two-second limit can be tested and verified.\n   - **Contextual**: It mentions \"normal operating conditions,\" which helps define the environment in which this performance is expected.\n\nBy reformulating the requirement in this way, all stakeholders have a clear understanding of what is expected, which facilitates better design, implementation, and testing processes."
