        "answer": "Requirements elicitation is a crucial phase in the requirements engineering process, where stakeholders' needs and expectations are gathered and documented. There are several techniques commonly used for requirements elicitation, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The main techniques of requirements elicitation include:\n\n1. **Interviews**: Conducting one-on-one or group interviews with stakeholders to gather their perspectives, preferences, and requirements. Interviews allow for in-depth discussions and the opportunity to clarify ambiguous requirements.\n\n2. **Workshops**: Bringing together a group of stakeholders in a facilitated session to discuss and define requirements collaboratively. Workshops promote active participation, knowledge sharing, and consensus building among stakeholders.\n\n3. **Scenarios**: Creating realistic usage scenarios or stories that describe how the system will be used in different situations. Scenarios help stakeholders visualize the system's behavior and identify key requirements based on specific user interactions.\n\n4. **Prototyping**: Developing a basic prototype or mock-up of the system to demonstrate functionality and gather feedback from stakeholders. Prototyping helps stakeholders better understand the requirements by providing a tangible representation of the system.\n\n5. **Facilitated Meetings**: Organizing structured meetings with stakeholders to discuss and prioritize requirements. Facilitated meetings ensure that all relevant stakeholders are involved in the requirements elicitation process and help in resolving conflicts or discrepancies.\n\n6. **Observation**: Observing stakeholders in their work environment to understand their tasks, challenges, and requirements. Observation provides valuable insights into stakeholders' behaviors and needs that may not be explicitly stated.\n\nEach of these techniques has its own advantages and is suitable for different contexts and types of projects. It is common for requirements engineers to use a combination of these techniques to ensure comprehensive and accurate requirements gathering. The choice of elicitation technique depends on factors such as project complexity, stakeholder availability, and the nature of the system being developed."

        "answer": "Requirements elicitation is the process of gathering, analyzing, and documenting requirements from stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations for a system or product. There are several techniques commonly used in requirements elicitation to effectively gather and clarify requirements. Some of the main techniques include:\n\n1. Interviews: Conducting one-on-one or group interviews with stakeholders to gather information about their needs, preferences, and expectations for the system. Interviews allow for in-depth discussions and the opportunity to ask follow-up questions to clarify requirements.\n\n2. Surveys and Questionnaires: Distributing surveys or questionnaires to stakeholders to collect information about their requirements. Surveys can be useful for gathering input from a large number of stakeholders and identifying common themes or patterns in their responses.\n\n3. Workshops and Focus Groups: Organizing workshops or focus groups with stakeholders to facilitate discussions, brainstorming, and collaboration on requirements. Workshops can help stakeholders to share their perspectives, identify conflicting requirements, and reach a consensus on priorities.\n\n4. Observations: Observing stakeholders in their work environment to understand how they currently perform tasks, identify pain points, and uncover implicit requirements that may not be explicitly stated. Observations can provide valuable insights into stakeholders' needs and behaviors.\n\n5. Prototyping: Creating prototypes or mockups of the system to demonstrate functionality and gather feedback from stakeholders. Prototypes can help stakeholders visualize the system, provide feedback on design decisions, and refine requirements based on their interactions with the prototype.\n\n6. Document Analysis: Reviewing existing documentation, such as business processes, user manuals, and system specifications, to extract requirements and identify gaps or inconsistencies. Document analysis can help to understand the context of the system and validate requirements against existing information.\n\n7. Brainstorming: Encouraging stakeholders to generate ideas, suggestions, and requirements through a creative and collaborative brainstorming session. Brainstorming can help to generate new requirements, explore different perspectives, and stimulate innovative solutions.\n\n8. Use Cases and Scenarios: Developing use cases and scenarios to describe how stakeholders interact with the system and achieve their goals. Use cases can help to clarify requirements, define system boundaries, and identify key functionalities from the user's perspective.\n\nBy using a combination of these techniques, requirements engineers can effectively elicit, analyze, and prioritize requirements to ensure that the system meets the needs and expectations of stakeholders."
