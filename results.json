It outlines the steps taken by the user and the system's responses, providing clarity on the functional requirements of the system. Here\u2019s a detailed example of a textual use case for an online banking application:\n\n### Use Case: Transfer Funds Between Accounts\n\n**Use Case ID:** UC-001  \n**Use Case Name:** Transfer Funds Between Accounts  \n**Actor:** Bank Customer  \n**Preconditions:**  \n- The customer must be logged into their online banking account.  \n- The customer must have at least two accounts (e.g., Checking and Savings) with sufficient balance in the source account.\n\n**Postconditions:**  \n- The specified amount is transferred from the source account to the destination account.  \n- The transaction is recorded in the transaction history of both accounts.\n\n**Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow):**  \n1. The customer navigates to the \"Transfer Funds\" section of the online banking application.  \n2. The system displays the available accounts for transfer.  \n3. The customer selects the source account (e.g., Checking) from which the funds will be transferred.  \n4. The customer selects the destination account (e.g., Savings) to which the funds will be transferred.  \n5. The customer enters the amount to be transferred (e.g., $100).  \n6. The customer reviews the transfer details and confirms the transaction.  \n7. The system verifies that the source account has sufficient funds.  \n8. The system processes the transfer and updates the balances of both accounts.  \n9. The system displays a confirmation message indicating the transfer was successful.  \n10. The system updates the transaction history for both accounts to reflect the transfer.\n\n**Extensions (Alternative Flows):**  \n- **A1: Insufficient Funds**  \n  1. If the source account does not have sufficient funds, the system displays an error message indicating insufficient funds.  \n  2. The customer is prompted to either enter a different amount or cancel the transaction.\n\n- **A2: Invalid Amount**  \n  1. If the customer enters an invalid amount (e.g., negative number or zero), the system displays an error message.  \n  2. The customer is prompted to enter a valid amount.\n\n- **A3: Cancel Transaction**  \n  1. At any point before confirmation, the customer can choose to cancel the transaction.  \n  2. The system returns the customer to the previous screen without making any changes.\n\n**Special Requirements:**  \n- The system must ensure that all transactions are secure and comply with banking regulations.  \n- The system should provide a user-friendly interface for easy navigation.  \n- The system must log all transactions for auditing purposes.\n\n**Frequency of Use:**  \n- This use case is expected to be used frequently by customers for managing their finances.\n\nThis textual use case provides a comprehensive overview of the fund transfer process, detailing the interactions between the user and the system, as well as the conditions and requirements necessary for successful execution. It serves as a valuable tool for developers and stakeholders to understand the functional requirements of the online banking application.",

                "answer": "Functional and non-functional requirements are two fundamental categories of requirements in software engineering and systems development. Understanding the distinction between them is crucial for successful project planning, design, and implementation.\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\nFunctional requirements specify what a system should do. They describe the specific behaviors, functions, and features that the system must support. These requirements are often expressed in terms of inputs, outputs, and the interactions between the system and its users or other systems. Functional requirements answer the question: \"What should the system do?\"\n\n**Examples of Functional Requirements:**\n1. **User Authentication:** The system must allow users to register, log in, and log out.\n2. **Data Processing:** The system must process user input and generate reports based on that data.\n3. **Search Functionality:** The system must enable users to search for products by name, category, or price range.\n4. **Transaction Handling:** The system must support online payment processing and provide confirmation of successful transactions.\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n\nNon-functional requirements, on the other hand, define how a system performs its functions. They specify the quality attributes, system performance, and constraints that the system must adhere to. Non-functional requirements answer the question: \"How should the system perform?\"\n\n**Examples of Non-Functional Requirements:**\n1. **Performance:** The system must handle 1000 concurrent users with a response time of less than 2 seconds.\n2. **Scalability:** The system should be able to scale to accommodate a 50% increase in user load without degradation in performance.\n3. **Security:** The system must comply with industry standards for data encryption and user privacy.\n4. **Usability:** The system should be intuitive and easy to navigate, with a user satisfaction rating of at least 85%.\n5. **Reliability:** The system must have an uptime of 99.9% and be able to recover from failures within 5 minutes.\n\n### Key Differences\n\n1. **Nature:**\n   - Functional requirements are concerned with specific functionalities and behaviors.\n   - Non-functional requirements focus on the quality and performance of those functionalities.\n\n2. **Measurement:**\n   - Functional requirements can often be tested and verified through specific use cases or scenarios.\n   - Non-functional requirements are typically measured through metrics, such as response time, throughput, and user satisfaction.\n\n3. **Impact:**\n   - Functional requirements directly impact the system's capabilities and user interactions.\n   - Non-functional requirements influence the overall user experience, system performance, and maintainability.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth functional and non-functional requirements are essential for the successful development of a system. While functional requirements define what the system should do, non-functional requirements ensure that it does so effectively and efficiently. A comprehensive understanding and documentation of both types of requirements are critical for meeting user needs and achieving project goals.",

This checklist is designed to help ensure that security considerations are integrated into the development of a system from the outset.\n\n### Security Requirements Checklist\n\n#### 1. **Authentication**\n   - [ ] **User Authentication**: Define how users will authenticate (e.g., username/password, multi-factor authentication).\n   - [ ] **Session Management**: Specify session timeout and re-authentication requirements.\n   - [ ] **Account Lockout**: Determine policies for account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.\n\n#### 2. **Authorization**\n   - [ ] **Access Control**: Define roles and permissions for users and groups.\n   - [ ] **Least Privilege**: Ensure users have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks.\n   - [ ] **Data Access**: Specify rules for data access based on user roles.\n\n#### 3. **Data Protection**\n   - [ ] **Data Encryption**: Identify requirements for encrypting data at rest and in transit.\n   - [ ] **Data Integrity**: Specify mechanisms to ensure data integrity (e.g., checksums, hashes).\n   - [ ] **Data Retention**: Define policies for data retention and deletion.\n\n#### 4. **Network Security**\n   - [ ] **Firewall Requirements**: Specify firewall configurations and rules.\n   - [ ] **Intrusion Detection/Prevention**: Identify requirements for intrusion detection and prevention systems.\n   - [ ] **Secure Communication**: Define protocols for secure communication (e.g., HTTPS, VPN).\n\n#### 5. **Application Security**\n   - [ ] **Input Validation**: Specify requirements for validating user inputs to prevent injection attacks.\n   - [ ] **Error Handling**: Define how errors will be handled and logged without exposing sensitive information.\n   - [ ] **Security Testing**: Identify requirements for security testing (e.g., penetration testing, code reviews).\n\n#### 6. **Compliance and Standards**\n   - [ ] **Regulatory Compliance**: Identify applicable regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and ensure requirements align.\n   - [ ] **Security Standards**: Specify adherence to security standards (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST).\n\n#### 7. **Incident Response**\n   - [ ] **Incident Response Plan**: Define requirements for an incident response plan, including roles and responsibilities.\n   - [ ] **Logging and Monitoring**: Specify requirements for logging security events and monitoring for suspicious activity.\n   - [ ] **Reporting Mechanisms**: Define how security incidents will be reported and escalated.\n\n#### 8. **Physical Security**\n   - [ ] **Access Control**: Specify physical access controls for facilities housing sensitive systems.\n   - [ ] **Environmental Controls**: Identify requirements for environmental controls (e.g., fire suppression, temperature control).\n\n#### 9. **User Awareness and Training**\n   - [ ] **Security Training**: Define requirements for user security awareness training.\n   - [ ] **Phishing Awareness**: Specify training on recognizing and reporting phishing attempts.\n\n#### 10. **Third-Party Security**\n   - [ ] **Vendor Assessment**: Define requirements for assessing the security posture of third-party vendors.\n   - [ ] **Data Sharing Agreements**: Specify requirements for data sharing agreements with third parties.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis checklist serves as a foundational tool for gathering and validating security requirements throughout the software development lifecycle. It is important to tailor the checklist to the specific context of the project and to engage stakeholders in discussions about security needs. Regular reviews and updates to the checklist may also be necessary to adapt to evolving security threats and compliance requirements.",
