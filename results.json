                "answer": "Functional and non-functional requirements are two essential categories of requirements in software engineering and systems development.\n\n### Functional Requirements\nFunctional requirements specify what a system should do. They describe the behaviors, functions, and features that the system must support. These requirements are often expressed in terms of inputs, outputs, and the interactions between the system and its users or other systems. Key characteristics include:\n\n- **Specificity**: Clearly define actions the system must perform.\n- **User-Centric**: Focus on user needs and system capabilities.\n- **Examples**:\n  - User authentication (login/logout).\n  - Data processing (calculating totals, generating reports).\n  - System interfaces (APIs, user interfaces).\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\nNon-functional requirements define how a system performs its functions. They address the quality attributes, constraints, and overall system performance rather than specific behaviors. Key characteristics include:\n\n- **Quality Attributes**: Focus on aspects like performance, security, usability, and reliability.\n- **Constraints**: May include regulatory compliance, hardware limitations, or environmental conditions.\n- **Examples**:\n  - Performance (response time, throughput).\n  - Security (encryption standards, access controls).\n  - Usability (user interface design, accessibility standards).\n  - Reliability (uptime, fault tolerance).\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, functional requirements outline what the system should do, while non-functional requirements describe how the system should perform those functions. Both are critical for ensuring that the final product meets user expectations and operates effectively within its intended environment.",
