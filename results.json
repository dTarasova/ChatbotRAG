                "answer": "Certainly! Below is a template for a textual use case that you can use to document the interactions between users (actors) and a system to achieve a specific goal. This template includes key sections that are typically found in a use case document.\n\n---\n\n# Use Case Template\n\n## Use Case Title\n**[Title of the Use Case]**\n\n## Use Case ID\n**[Unique Identifier]**\n\n## Version\n**[Version Number]**\n\n## Author\n**[Author's Name]**\n\n## Date\n**[Date of Creation]**\n\n## Actors\n- **Primary Actor:** [The main user or system that initiates the use case]\n- **Secondary Actors:** [Other users or systems that interact with the primary actor]\n\n## Preconditions\n**[Conditions that must be true before the use case can be initiated]**\n\n## Postconditions\n**[Conditions that will be true after the use case has been successfully completed]**\n\n## Main Success Scenario\n1. **[Step 1: Description of the first action taken by the primary actor]**\n2. **[Step 2: Description of the system's response]**\n3. **[Step 3: Description of the next action taken by the primary actor]**\n4. **[Continue detailing the steps until the goal is achieved]**\n\n## Extensions (Alternative Scenarios)\n- **[Extension 1: Description of an alternative path or exception that can occur]**\n- **[Extension 2: Description of another alternative path or exception]**\n- **[Continue detailing any other alternative scenarios]**\n\n## Special Requirements\n**[Any specific requirements or constraints related to the use case, such as performance, security, or regulatory requirements]**\n\n## Frequency of Use\n**[How often this use case is expected to be executed]**\n\n## Assumptions\n**[Any assumptions made during the creation of this use case]**\n\n## Notes\n**[Any additional notes or comments related to the use case]**\n\n---\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n## Use Case Title\nUser Login\n\n## Use Case ID\nUC-001\n\n## Version\n1.0\n\n## Author\nJohn Doe\n\n## Date\n2023-10-01\n\n## Actors\n- **Primary Actor:** User\n- **Secondary Actors:** Authentication System\n\n## Preconditions\n- The user must have a registered account.\n\n## Postconditions\n- The user is logged into the system and redirected to the dashboard.\n\n## Main Success Scenario\n1. The user navigates to the login page.\n2. The user enters their username and password.\n3. The user clicks the \"Login\" button.\n4. The system validates the credentials.\n5. The system logs the user in and redirects them to the dashboard.\n\n## Extensions (Alternative Scenarios)\n- **Extension 1:** If the user enters incorrect credentials, the system displays an error message and prompts the user to try again.\n- **Extension 2:** If the user forgets their password, they can click on the \"Forgot Password\" link to initiate a password recovery process.\n\n## Special Requirements\n- The login process must be completed within 5 seconds for a good user experience.\n- Passwords must be stored securely using encryption.\n\n## Frequency of Use\n- Daily, as users log in to access their accounts.\n\n## Assumptions\n- Users have internet access to reach the login page.\n\n## Notes\n- Consider implementing multi-factor authentication for enhanced security in future versions.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to modify this template to suit your specific needs or the context of your project!",
