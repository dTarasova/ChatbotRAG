            "GPT": {
                "answer": "**Answer**: Focus groups are a valuable method for eliciting requirements due to their ability to gather diverse perspectives, foster interactive discussions, and uncover insights that may not emerge through other methods.\n\n**Details**:\n\n1. **Diverse Perspectives**: \n   - Focus groups bring together individuals from various backgrounds, experiences, and expertise. This diversity can lead to a richer understanding of user needs and preferences. For example, in a software development project, including end-users, stakeholders, and technical staff can highlight different requirements that might be overlooked if only one group were consulted.\n\n2. **Interactive Discussions**: \n   - The group setting encourages participants to engage in dialogue, prompting them to build on each other's ideas. This interaction can lead to the emergence of new concepts and requirements that may not surface in one-on-one interviews. For instance, a participant might mention a feature they find useful, which could inspire others to share similar needs or concerns.\n\n3. **Immediate Feedback**: \n   - Focus groups allow for real-time feedback on ideas, prototypes, or concepts. Facilitators can present preliminary designs or requirements and gauge participants' reactions, enabling quick adjustments based on collective input. This iterative process can significantly enhance the quality of the final requirements.\n\n4. **Exploration of Complex Issues**: \n   - Certain topics may be sensitive or complex, making it difficult for individuals to express their thoughts in isolation. Focus groups create a supportive environment where participants can discuss these issues more openly, leading to deeper insights. For example, discussing user privacy concerns in a group can help identify common fears and expectations.\n\n5. **Identification of Priorities**: \n   - Through discussion and consensus-building, focus groups can help prioritize requirements based on group agreement. This collective prioritization can be more effective than individual assessments, as it reflects a broader consensus on what is most important to users.\n\n6. **Cost-Effectiveness**: \n   - Conducting a focus group can be more efficient than multiple individual interviews, as it allows for the collection of a wide range of information in a single session. This can save time and resources while still yielding valuable insights.\n\n7. **Enhanced Engagement**: \n   - Participants often feel more engaged and valued when they are part of a group discussion. This can lead to increased motivation to contribute and share their thoughts, resulting in more comprehensive data collection.\n\nIn summary, focus groups are an effective elicitation technique in requirements engineering, providing a platform for collaborative exploration of user needs, fostering creativity, and ensuring that a wide range of perspectives is considered in the requirements-gathering process.",
