        "answer": "Requirements elicitation is a crucial phase in the requirements engineering process, where stakeholders' needs and expectations are gathered and documented. There are several techniques commonly used for requirements elicitation, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The main techniques of requirements elicitation include:\n\n1. **Interviews**: Conducting one-on-one or group interviews with stakeholders to gather information about their needs, preferences, and expectations. Interviews allow for in-depth discussions and the opportunity to clarify ambiguous requirements.\n\n2. **Workshops**: Bringing together a group of stakeholders in a facilitated session to discuss and define requirements collaboratively. Workshops promote active participation, knowledge sharing, and consensus building among stakeholders.\n\n3. **Scenarios**: Creating realistic usage scenarios or stories that describe how the system will be used in different situations. Scenarios help stakeholders visualize the system's behavior and identify key requirements.\n\n4. **Prototyping**: Building a basic version of the system or a mock-up to demonstrate functionality and gather feedback from stakeholders. Prototypes help stakeholders better understand the requirements and provide early validation of the system's design.\n\n5. **Facilitated Meetings**: Organizing structured meetings with stakeholders to discuss and prioritize requirements. Facilitated meetings ensure that all stakeholders have a voice in the requirements elicitation process and help in resolving conflicts or discrepancies.\n\n6. **Observation**: Observing stakeholders in their work environment to understand their tasks, challenges, and interactions with existing systems. Observation provides valuable insights into implicit requirements that stakeholders may not explicitly communicate.\n\nEach of these techniques has its own advantages and is suitable for different contexts and types of projects. It is common for requirements engineers to use a combination of these techniques to ensure comprehensive and accurate requirements gathering. The choice of elicitation technique depends on factors such as the project scope, stakeholder availability, project timeline, and the nature of the system being developed."
